Hi, my name is Satish Gawade. I’ve completed my Bachelor’s in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering and have around 3 years of professional experience in software development.

During this time, I’ve worked extensively with a US-based client in the finance domain, mainly on an application focused on taxation and consultation. My primary responsibilities include designing and developing RESTful APIs, handling SQL Server database operations, and contributing to MVC-based applications.

One of my major projects was a workflow-driven application, where I developed multiple workflow steps with endpoints for GET, POST, PATCH, and DELETE operations. I also implemented FluentValidation to maintain data integrity during workflow transitions.

In addition to backend development, I’ve also worked on Azure Logic Apps to automate workflow creation and integrate multiple systems. I regularly collaborate with clients to gather requirements, work on enhancements, and resolve production issues.

Overall, I’m passionate about building scalable and efficient backend systems, automating workflows, and ensuring smooth application performance and user experience.
