The main project I worked on is called the Financial Statement Review, or FSR Workflow. It’s a web-based application developed for a US-based finance and consulting firm, and it’s mainly used to manage and automate the financial report review process for different client engagements.

The main goal of the project was to replace a lot of manual steps that teams used to do through emails and spreadsheets, and instead bring everything into one structured and automated workflow system.

The workflow includes one main process and two parallel sub-workflows — one for Financial Report Processing and another for Engagement Quality Review.
These two workflows run simultaneously, so multiple users can work in parallel. To support this, we created a tab-based form where each tab represents a section of the workflow, and users have controlled access — for example, if someone is working on the financial report side, their tab is editable while the other tabs remain read-only to avoid data conflicts.

I was mainly responsible for developing RESTful APIs for each workflow step — like GET, POST, PATCH, and DELETE operations.
I also implemented FluentValidation for model-level validation to make sure data integrity is maintained during workflow transitions.

Another interesting part of this project was integration with CaseWare and CaseView tools, which automatically generate PDF and RTF deliverables and upload them into the CaseWare document manager.
We also integrated with another workflow called Assurance Consultation, which allowed users to view related consultation details directly inside the FSR form.

From the backend side, I also worked on Azure Logic Apps to automate certain workflow creation processes and to handle background activities like document generation and API integrations.

Overall, my role involved API development, database design using SQL Server, Logic App workflows, and client interaction for requirement gathering, issue resolution, and enhancements.

This project really helped me understand workflow-driven application design, parallel processing, and how to build scalable backend systems integrated with external tools.
